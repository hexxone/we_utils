# [we_utils](https://github.com/hexxone/we_utils)

### is a collection of utilities, mostly usefull when creating Wallpaper Engine Web Wallpapers with TypeScript / Webpack.

I created this repository since I was previously copying back-and-forth lots of code between projects.
Keeping track of this stuff manually is annoying...
